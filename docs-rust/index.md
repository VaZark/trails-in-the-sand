# Rust Docs

This page gives an overview that is personally digestable for the core and advanced concepts of Rust.

## What to expect

These will usually be in the format of oversimplifications with an occasional note on other possible usecases, implementations and my interpretation that doesn't line up with official docs. There will also be comparisons against other features in Rust and/or other languages 

Blogposts will be made for only complete or specific non-trivial workflows that cannot be understood by going through the docs of the associated libs or services.
