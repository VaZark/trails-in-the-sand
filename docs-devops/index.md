# Docker

Docker is super useful in isolating applications and creating deterministic builds of your application. Its best feature is that these isolated containers can be treated as services in a containerised network. The dev has ability to choose the services and ports to expose to the world, as all docker containers are private by default.

The most important and frequently used features are

1. Docker builds : Creating Docker files
2. Docker Compose : YAML specification used to describe how to link up and use one or more Docker files in a network
